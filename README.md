A tft match scraper, inspired from github.com/fattorib/LeagueMatchScraper.

created in a learning process, i've tested the AI accuracy and gotta say it doesn't look very nice, 20 % in test data

but it doesn't get really far from the answer, so i guess if we used it aiming at 1st place, worst case (hopefully) is getting 3rd or 4th, which is positive reanked wise in tft

you can find what i extracted in https://www.kaggle.com/hamzaachehboune/tft-advisor.
